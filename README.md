# Disfluency Detection and Explanation in Conversations
This project is done as part of the fullfilment of the course CSE 590.

This github repository has two files:
* `BERT_training.ipynb`: This notebook trains a BERT base model to predict word level disfluency
* `GENAI_DEMO.ipynb`: This notebook performs end-to-end predictions of word level disfluency along with explanations generated from Gemini 2.5 Flash directly from audio.

The data used in this project has been obtained from [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/fluency/teaching/AWS.html).
